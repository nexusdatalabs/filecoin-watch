## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- Pages are markdown thanks to MDX.
- Scripts write data locally. Filter, transform in frontmatter. Slice the data server-side (Astro) to ship less data to the client.
- Interactive (hover to get values) chart.
- Collections based on rows in datasets (e.g. each use can have it's own page with custom charts, `/user/<id>`).
- Hydrate nothing by default; use Astro islands only where interactivity is required.
- Fully static website.
- Keep things as vanilla as possible.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
